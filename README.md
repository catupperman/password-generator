# password-generator
**The Project Itself**
In this project the HTML and CSS were mapped out with minimal JavaScript written.  The goal was to make the visual element of the password box, to interact and generate a secure password for the user, while maintaining the password permameters set by the client.

**The Process**
To start, I created a shell of what I thought I might need within the code.  Putting notes down to help me focus on the sections that I was struggling to figure out.  I set sections of possible code, and notes that I might need within the different sections.  This was sort of my process of putting the puzzle pieces in color cordinated piles. Then the fun part putting it all together, I refrenced back to several of the elements learned in JavaScript week one, and tried to combine them with the few things I learned about in week 2. I googled things I was unsure of and refrenced MDN quite a bit. Testing the code lines as I went along, to ensure an error didn't appear on the console.  Every once in a while I had to make some adjustments, due to an error.  After googling several items, I learned some new coding combos I hadn't seen before, and was able to get the webpage to work. PUZZLE COMPLETE, HUZZAH!
